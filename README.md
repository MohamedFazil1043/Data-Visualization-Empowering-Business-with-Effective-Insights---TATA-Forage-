## Task 1 - Framing the Business Scenario

Learn how to anticipate the questions your business leaders will need answers to.

### Background info and context

An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business is performing well, and the management wants to analyze the major contributing factors to revenue to strategically plan for next year.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what’s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information available in the data.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO is scheduled for next month, and you need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion.

Remember, thinking from the perspective of business leaders allows you to analyze the data more effectively and present better insights.

### Details for task

To prepare for your meeting, draft questions that you think will be important and relevant to the CEO and CMO. This preparation will guide you as you develop your presentation.

You’ve been provided a dataset in the resources below to use as the basis for your exploration. Review this data, noting what information has been provided, what insights you can garner, and what is relevant to both the CEO and CMO respectively.

Create a set of four questions that you anticipate each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to. Eight (8) questions in total (4 for the CEO and 4 for the CMO).

## Task 2 - Choosing the Right Visuals

Learn which visuals are most effective in a given scenario.

### Background info and context

You have been asked by the CEO and CMO to provide visuals on the metrics they wish to analyze for the online retail store. You will gather the requirements and provide them with the type of visual that would be best suited to the scenario. The senior management wants to understand how their business is performing and what areas are the key strengths of the company. They are also focused on identifying opportunities that would lead to growth and generate more revenue in the future.

### Details for task

In this task, you will read the questions carefully and understand the business requirement. Once you have an idea of what is required from the perspective of the CEO and CMO, you will need to come up with the perfect visual which will illustrate what the senior managers are looking for in each scenario. Remember, data can be presented in multiple types of charts, but you are required to select the visual that would best display the information being presented.

You will be provided resources on how to select visuals based on the different scenarios, available in the resources section. These resources will help you get an idea on which visual to select for the given business scenario and will also guide you on how to choose the right chart or graph for your data. Each question will contain a unique scenario and you will be expected to answer the questions based on that scenario.

To complete this task, answer the multiple-choice quiz. Start the quiz by clicking 'Click here to start the task' in section 5 below. Please note there are 5 multiple choice questions to complete in this task. Please be patient as each question loads.

## Task 3 - Creating Effective Visuals

Apply your understanding and create visuals based on business scenarios.

### Background info and context

The CEO and CMO have recently met to finalize the requirements and would like you to provide them with some analysis and visuals that would help answer their questions. Both executives are interested in viewing and understanding how they can use the data to make more meaningful decisions. You would need to provide insights which they can use to create the expansion strategy. The executives want to analyze the trends and the breakdown by different categories so that they have clarity on how the revenue is being generated and what are the main factors affecting the online store.

### Details for task

In this task, you will create the visuals around four of the questions that the CEO and CMO have requested. You can use either Tableau or Power BI to create the visuals and we’ve provided the data in the resources below.
Both Power BI and Tableau have free trials that can be accessed in order to complete this task. You can find a resource below that directs you how to download these free trials.

### Data cleanup

Before you can begin the analysis, make sure that the data is cleaned properly. You have noticed that the data contains some returns to the store which are provided in negative quantities and there are unit prices which were input in error. You will need to perform the following steps to clean this data.

- Create a check that the quantity should not be below 1 unit
- Create a check that the Unit price should not be below $0

Please note that in order to apply the checks that have been mentioned above, you would need to use conditional formulas where the logic would state that if the conditions are met then the tool should exclude the data.

You will need to upload your work at the end of the task.

## Task 4 - Communicating Insights and Analysis

Communicate the findings from your visuals and analysis to the CEO and CMO.

### Background info and context

You are now ready to present your analysis to the CEO and CMO. They are excited to see how the visuals you have created can help them understand their business better and identify the areas that need focus for expansion and growth. They are also keen on understanding the relationship between different variables which might affect the online store’s performance.

### Details for task

In this task, you will create a presentation using the visuals created in the previous task and you will also need to provide a narrative around each visual explaining how it answers the questions posed by the CEO and CMO. The presentation will require you to communicate effectively and convincingly, ensuring that you convey the right insights from the data.

You will need to submit the presentation in PDF format at the end of the task.
